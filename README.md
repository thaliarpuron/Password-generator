# Password-generator

This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

When the button "Generate Password" is clicked, the user is prompted to determine the length of the password. The user has to choose a length of at least 8 and no more than 128 characters, otherwise he/she will get an alert notifying that parameter. 

Then the user has to confirm if he/she would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in the password. The criteria the user choose, has to be validated and at least one character type should be selected. If the user selects none, an alert will show notifying that he/she has to select at least one parameter.

Finally, the password is generated and displayed in the page.
